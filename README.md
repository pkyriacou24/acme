## Note

The Mission: -

Acme Widget Co are the leading provider of made up widgets and they’ve contracted you to
create a proof of concept for their new sales system.

Mission Analysis: -
Based on the mission statement is to produce a prove on concept sales system, its unclear if the
contract is based on the following: -

1, The contract is a payed contract or not
2, If ACME Widgets Co are happy with the concept will software company be retained to produce the complete sales system

Approach: -
Based on the above analysys of the mission, the development company has decided to take the following approach: -
1, Keep it simple, but provide all the features in the requirements
2, Ensure the amount of resources and time are kept to a minimum, ensuring minimum expenditure due to point 1 of the Mission analysis.
3, Aesthetics and usability must be simplistic ensuring the user journey is kept to the highest standard.


## Assumption

1, I assumed that the target platform can be any platform for the proof of concept
2, Any development language can be used, I considered C#, however decided PHP and Javascript using VS 2017 as the IDE.
3, No db will be used and decided to utilise Classes and arrays

## How to use

1, Navigate the index file
2, Select the Product in the dropdown
3, Click add to add to the order
4, Click delete to remove the product from the order
5, Sub total, delivery and total are automatically calculated

## total cost calculation

1, Catalogue Class adds a product to the catalogue
2, Delivry Class adds the delivery options to the delivery container
3, addProductCart adds the product to the order list
4, reacalculateCost, recalculates after deleting a product from the order list
5, reacalculateTotalCost, calculates all the costs within the order list

## Use Case Modal

I have added a target UseCase which goes beyond the initial concept and provides a vision of the target system if the development company retains our services
